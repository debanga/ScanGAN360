# ScanGAN360
Code and model for the paper "[ScanGAN360: A Generative Model of Realistic Scanpaths for 360ยบ Images](http://webdiis.unizar.es/~danims/projects/vr-scanpaths.html)".

![Teaser](https://github.com/DaniMS-ZGZ/ScanGAN360/blob/main/img/vr-scanpaths.jpg)

## Requirements
This work was developed using:
```
* python 3.7.4
* pytorch 1.2.0
* cudatoolkit 10.0.30
* opencv 4.1.2
```
You can install an environment with all required dependencies using `scangan360.yml` file in Anaconda. 

## Inference
The current version of the repository includes a basic, yet functional version to generate scanpaths from a 360ยบ image using the ScanGAN360 model.

### Usage
```
python main.py --mode inference 
```

This will read an image `image_path = "data/test.jpg"` and generate a set of scanpaths that will be saved in `path_to_save = "test/"`. You can modify both those paths, and the number of generated scanpaths `n_generated`. Each of the images will contain 25 different scanpaths.

## Training the model
Training is now available. [Updated June 15th]

```
python main.py --mode train 
```

Make sure you have correctly updated `utils.py`, including all the directories required. Also, check the `data` folder to download the required images and processed gaze data.

Checkpoints and models are saved periodically in the assigned folder.


## Download Nvidia driver: 
1. In Ubuntu, check Software & Update app => Additional Software => Select Nvidia Driver and install
2. After it finishes it will ask to set a password for reboot
3. After reboot MOK blue window will appear, enter the password in the next steps, and proceed to reboot from the menu
4. After reboot check installation using `nvidia-smi` command
